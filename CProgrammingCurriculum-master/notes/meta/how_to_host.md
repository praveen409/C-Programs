# Hosting The C Programming Study Group
If you're looking to run a Women Who Code C Programming Study Group where you
can offer talks and exercises that build skill and understanding over time,
you've come to the right place.

## Requirements
To conduct this study group, it's best to have:

C Programming Leads - Leaders who have experience programming C or have studied
the C Programming Language before, and who are willing to commit to plan and
facilitate this study group. What to leaders do? Some of the following:

 - Complete the week's readings and exercises ahead of time
 - Find guest speakers or give a demo themselves of topic for that week
 - Encourage connection and collaboration between attendees
 - Answer questions about C Programming
 - Find hosts for the event
 - Sent out invitations

## Tools and Resources
 -  Online invitation ([example from past event][c-meetup-event-example])
 -  Location: an office space
 -  Projector
 -  This curriculum (and links to it in whatever form is easiest)
 -  White Boards (Optional)

## Attendees
This meetup will be focused on learning the basics of C and supporting
ongoing C learners. Targeted for programmers who already know at least one
programming language, are excited about learning C, and would love to better
understand the inner workings of memory management.

## Online Invitation Sample:
```
This meetup will be focused on learning the basics of C and supporting ongoing C
learners. Targeted for programmers who already know at least one programming
language, are excited about learning C, and would love to better understand the
inner workings of memory management.

8-week series curriculum:

Part I - Introduction to the Language
2/5 - Installation, Compilers, and Hello World
2/19 - Language Basics, Part 1
3/5 - Language Basics, Part 2
3/19 - C-specific Basics

Part II - More Advanced Topics; Project **
4/2 - Pointers and Standard Libraries
4/16 - Memory Allocation
4/30 - Datatypes
5/14 - Advanced Lab

Please try to attend the early sessions if you're new to the language, as we
will unfortunately not be repeating material.

Who should take this series?
* Programmers with skill in one other programming language, like Ruby.
* Programmers who need to relearn C.
* Objective-C programmers who want better C skills.
* Programmers who want to learn more about memory management.

** Curriculum subject to change

## About C Programming
C is an imperative, compiled language and studying C can expand your
understanding of procedural programming and direct memory handling.

Is C still relevant? Yes! Because:
 - Many languages borrow its syntax style
   -  eg. JavaScript, C++, Go, Rust, Python
 - Foundational C layer for many languages
   - eg. Python, Julia, Objective-C, PHP
 - If you want to be able do anything at the system level, need a C library
 - Used in several areas of computing
 - Wearables (and other embedded devices)
 - Mobile devices
 - Security
 - Operating Systems (eg. linux kernel, android os)

## Additional Notes
This event is intended to be exclusively open for people who identify as women
-- queer and transgender friendly.

We originally scheduled this event bi-weekly, but weekly events would also work
well.

You can recruit outside speakers to give short presentations related to your
group's focus topic and also encourage members themselves to present something
new they've learned or share projects they are working on. Try to vary the level
of talks from beginner to more intermediate or advanced. Keep the presentation
short and informal however so the focus of the group is on self-paced study
time.

During study time, encourage members to speak up and help each other if they get
stuck. Allow members to study as they wish using the materials of their choice
or to work on personal projects. Members can either study independently or join
the small groups to work together as they prefer.
